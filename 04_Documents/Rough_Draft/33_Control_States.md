## State choices

To find suitable control states for your evaluation of opioid policies in Florida (FL) and Washington (WA), we need to focus on states with **similar healthcare, cultural, and environmental conditions while also ensuring that the states have weak or no state-level opioid regulations, or have not enforced them strongly during our study period**. Needless to say that it is important that the control states have weak or no state-level opioid regulations or enforcement during your study period to avoid confounding the results. Similar population size, demographic makeup and healthcare system characteristics ensure that differences in outcomes are more likely attributable to the state-level opioid policies rather than these underlying factors. Similar cultural attitudes toward drug use and the healthcare environment help to isolate the effects of opioid policies on the measured.

For Florica, we chose Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. Georgia has a similar demographic profile to Florida, with a mix of urban and rural populations. It shares some healthcare challenges and has not enacted as strict opioid regulations compared to states like New York or Massachusetts. The climate is similar, and there is a comparable level of opioid use and overdose deaths. Georgia has a similar demographic profile to Florida, with a mix of urban and rural populations. It shares some healthcare challenges and has not enacted as strict opioid regulations compared to states like New York or Massachusetts. The climate is similar, and there is a comparable level of opioid use and overdose deaths. South Carolina shares many cultural and healthcare characteristics with Florida, including a mix of urban and rural populations, a high percentage of elderly individuals, and similar healthcare access issues. Opioid regulation in South Carolina has been less aggressive, making it a good comparison state for Florida.

For Washington, we chose Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Oregon is geographically and culturally very similar to Washington, with a temperate climate, progressive policies, and similar healthcare systems. Both states have faced similar challenges regarding opioid misuse, but Oregon's regulations and enforcement have not been as strong as Washingtonâ€™s in recent years, which makes it a good comparison for evaluating Washington's policies. Idaho has similar environmental and cultural characteristics to Washington, with a more rural population and a similar temperate climate. However, Idaho has had less aggressive state-level opioid regulation compared to Washington, making it a useful control state to assess the impact of Washington's opioid policies. Montana shares environmental and cultural similarities with Washington, particularly with respect to its rural areas and mountainous climate. Its healthcare system is more challenged, and opioid regulations are not as strictly enforced as in Washington, making it a reasonable control state for comparative analysis.
