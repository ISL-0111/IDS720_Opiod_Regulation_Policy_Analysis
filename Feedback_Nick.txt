1. For control groups, you'll want to select a set of control states for each FL and WA.
You may do a pooled analysis as well, but you should plan on analyzing the two states separate, 
and potentially with distinct control samples. 

2. As discussed in class, deciding how many units to include as controls is a balancing act
â€” more controls means more statistical power, 
but to get more controls you have to include controls that are of decreasing similarity. 
So you have to justify your choice on that topic.
However, I will say you should work with at least three control states per state being studied. 


3. The idea here is to specify the variables that would be an input to your analysis, 
not to speak in general terms about data. 
Can you make the plots above with "number of opioids prescribed per county per year"? or "opioid volume"? (no). 
Many people have answers where, reading between the lines, 
I can see they probably get it, but I think an ideal response here would be "opioid shipments per capita in [units]". 
That kind of specificity helps readers notice precisely what they need to compute that.
Don't straight into potential sources and datasets, or types of data before doing the really granular, concrete part.

To-do
 - Set 3 control groups for FL, DC each (Econ, Geo, Trend)
 - Specify Variable names (e.g: MME, CALC, Dosage Unit)
 - Missing value(the mortality of drug use less than 10) treatment (Estimation model based on similar chraterestics, Deletion ..)
