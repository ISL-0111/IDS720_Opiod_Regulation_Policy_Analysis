#### Executive Summary

 This report evaluates the eﬀectiveness of state-level opioid regulations in Florida and Washington
in reducing opioid consumption and overdose mortality rates. Using pre-post and
diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences analyses, it examines trends in opioid shipments and mortality data from
2006 to 2015. Opioid shipment data from the Washington Post served as a measure of
consumption, while U.S. Vital Statistics mortality data tracked overdose deaths, with U.S. Census
Bureau population data providing context for rate-based analyses. The study focuses on
commonly misused prescription opioids, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, fentanyl,
and methadone. Control states—Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina for Florida, and
Colorado, Oregon, and Montana for Washington—were selected for their demographic and health
care similarities, oﬀering a baseline to distinguish policy impacts from broader trends.

Florida and Washington both initially stabilized opioid shipment growth after implementing their
respective policies, though the outcomes varied. In Florida, policies introduced in 2010 curbed the
sharp rise in opioid shipments, indicating some success in reducing overprescription. However,
similar stabilization trends in Florida’s control states suggest broader regional or national factors
may have played a role. In Washington, harm reduction policies enacted in 2012 led to a modest
initial decline in opioid shipments, but the eﬀect was minimal, with shipment level decreasing only
to a limited extent. In contrast, Washington’s control states showed more rapid declines, raising
questions about the relative eﬀectiveness of Washington’s measures. Mortality trends revealed
distinct contrasts between the two states. Florida experienced a decrease in opioid-related deaths
after its policies, though similar declines in control states point to additional national factors
influencing the trend. Washington, on the other hand, saw a slight increase in overdose mortality
during the same period. This suggests that while limiting prescription opioids may reduce misuse,
it can also push individuals toward riskier alternatives like heroin or fentanyl. These findings
highlight the need to balance prescription controls with complementary harm reduction strategies
to address substitution risks eﬀectively.

These findings emphasize the need to balance prescription regulations with strategies that
mitigate substitution risks. Florida’s policies showed greater success in reducing overdose deaths,
highlighting the importance of tailored approaches that account for each state’s unique
challenges. To combat the opioid crisis eﬀectively, flexible, data-driven strategies are essential,
combining regulatory measures with public health initiatives like expanded treatment access and
harm reduction programs. Insights from Florida and Washington oﬀer valuable guidance for
crafting interventions that address both the immediate and long-term complexities of opioid
misuse
